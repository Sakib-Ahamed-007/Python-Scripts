# Python-Scripts
In this repository I will share all the python scripts that I wrote while taking the course "Python & Ethical Hacking from Scratch" from Zsecurity.

## MAC Changer - MAC_Changer.py
This python script will change the MAC address of a Linux machine by taking the interface name and a MAC address as input to change it to the user provided MAC address.
```

Usage: MAC_Changer.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --interface=INTERFACE
                        Interface of the NIC
  -m NEW_MAC, --mac=NEW_MAC
                        New MAC address
